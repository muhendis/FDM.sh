# FDM.sh : Ä°nterface in one script

FDM.sh (File and Directory Management) provides an interface that runs on the terminal that handles general file and directory operations and basic data file operations.

## Running steps

Allow FDM.sh to run on first use (you do not need to repeat this step the next time you use it.)
```	
chmod 777 FDM.sh
```	

Then, it just remains to run this file.

```	
./FDM.sh
```
